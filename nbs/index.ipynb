      "When building production-ready machine learning systems, it is critical to monitor the health and performance of those systems with reports and visualizations. Furthermore, allowing for rapid debugging and interactive introspection is critical when workflows fail or do unexpected things. Jupyter notebooks have often been a preferred tool of data scientists for these tasks of visualization, exploration, debugging, and rapid iteration.  Ironically, many production systems do not integrate appropriately with notebooks, which can significantly frustrate progress on these tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, in the field of data science tooling, one of the most [hotly-contested](https://mlops.community/jupyter-notebooks-in-production/) questions is whether notebooks are suitable for production use. We believe that tools should strive to meet data scientists where they are instead of forcing them to adapt approaches from other disciplines not suited to their needs. This is why we are excited to introduce **Notebook Cards**, which allow data scientists to use notebooks for visualizing and debugging production workflows and help to bridge the MLOps divide between prototype and production. This allows data scientists to safely use notebooks for parts of their production workflows, without having to refactor code to conform to a different development environment. \n",
